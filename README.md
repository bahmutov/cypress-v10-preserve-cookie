## Install

```shell
# if using NPM
$ npm i -D cypress-v10-preserve-cookie
# if using Yarn
$ yarn add -D cypress-v10-preserve-cookie
```

Import this module from your spec file or from your support file

```js
import 'cypress-v10-preserve-cookie'
```

This module adds a custom command `cy.preserveCookieOnce`

## Use

### Single cookie

```js
// login sets the cookie like "connect.session" for example
before(loginSomehow)

beforeEach(() => {
  // equivalent to cy.preserveCookieOnce('connect.session')
  cy.preserveCookieOnce('connect.session')
})

it('is logged in', () => {
  ...
})

it('is still logged in', () => {
  ...
})
```

### Multiple cookies

You can pass multiple cookie names

```js
cy.preserveCookieOnce(
  'connect.session',
  'refresh_token',
  'access_token',
)
// equivalent to
cy.preserveCookieOnce('connect.session')
cy.preserveCookieOnce('refresh_token')
cy.preserveCookieOnce('access_token')
```

## Types

Included in [src/index.d.ts](./src/index.d.ts)

## Debugging

This module uses [debug](https://github.com/debug-js/debug#readme) module to output verbose browser console messages when needed. To turn the logging on, open the browser's DevTools console and set the local storage entry:

```js
localStorage.debug = 'cypress-v10-preserve-cookie'
```

If you re-run the tests, you should see the messages appear in the console.
